## Affiliate links

In the age of the attention economy, everyone is trying to get airtime for their product or service. I have been approached by numerous individuals and companies to try their software or courses, and most of the time I politely decline in order to prioritise my own projects. I will only promote products or services that I have used or am currently using. If approached by a company, I will only consider the product if it will add meaningful value to my life or address a clear challenge that I am experiencing. ¬†

Here are some affiliate links below for services that I would recommend and a short write-up of why:

- ### [Shortform](https://shortform.com/onestutteringmind?ref=onestutteringmind.com) for high quality book summaries¬†
  - There are thousands of non-fiction books out there, and everyone is convinced that the current book on their nightstand is a 'must-read'. Whilst I take note of these recommendations, there is only so much time in the world. We also all know the book that could have been a blog post, but then got padded with anecdotes to fill some page quota. [Shortform](https://shortform.com/onestutteringmind?ref=onestutteringmind.com)'s book summary service saves me a ton of time and FOMO. Their one-pager summaries are excellent and have spared me many laborious reads. My current go-to recommendation for a book to start with is ["Essentialism" by Greg McKeown](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/essentialism?ref=onestutteringmind.com) (not a laborious read, but a good summary nonetheless.)

- ### [Zoho One](https://go.zoho.com/vnq?ref=onestutteringmind.com) to build an operating system for your business
  - [Zoho One](https://go.zoho.com/vnq?ref=onestutteringmind.com) is an affordable Enterprise Resource Planning software solution for small to medium businesses. I use Zoho One for my business, [CombiningMinds](https:www.combiningminds.org), across a number of different functions‚Äìwebsite building, bookkeeping, customer relationship management, campaign management, surveys and feedback forms, and a host of others. In total there are over 45 integrated applications that make it the perfect operating system for your business.

### [Systeme.io](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0032401091807422f5f5f10b472fb5e3a9cc2adf&ref=onestutteringmind.com) for an affordable all-in-one solution for online courses

I wish I had discovered [Systeme.io](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0032401091807422f5f5f10b472fb5e3a9cc2adf&ref=onestutteringmind.com) earlier. It's cheaper than competitors like Thinkific, Teachable and Podia, but offers more value for money, with course hosting, email campaign management and website-building functionality. Setting up funnels and landing pages is quick, and the integrated email marketing is intuitive and easy to configure. The support team also have a good turnaround time on customer issues. There are some elements that could do with a bit of polish, but it's unbeatable when it comes to value for money.

## Work with me

I've thought a lot about systems and processes in the various roles that I've had, and I'm passionate about sorting out messy workflows. I'm starting a side project that will hopefully allow me to work with small companies or NPOs that align with some of the critical areas that I believe will make a difference in the world. If you'd like to work with me, check out [CombiningMinds](https://www.combiningminds.org/?ref=onestutteringmind.com). Please note, this is for consulting services only.
