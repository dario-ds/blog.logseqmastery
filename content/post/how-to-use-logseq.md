## Grasping the basics: blocks and pages

This was actually the last video I created on the topic, but it's arguably the most helpful. In this tutorial, I've created an analogue model to help you visualise how pages and blocks work within your Logseq database. This hands-on approach will give you a tangible understanding of how your information is stored and organised.
