## Why use templates in Logseq?

Creating templates requires minimal upfront effort, and they're a great way to build consistency in your database and reduce the friction of input. By using a few simple keystrokes to access a template, you save time instead of repeatedly typing out information, or copying and pasting it from a reference document.

## What makes for a good template?

A good template is one that you'll use frequently (i.e., almost every day), or that will save you significant time when you need to use it infrequently. 

Another good use of templates is to prompt your thinking. If you're writing a report, for example, you might have a series of question prompts that ensure you achieve all the deliverables. 

Templates can also be a forcing mechanism to help you link your knowledge. For example, my template for articles has a property for `tags::` which ensures that I don't skip the work of linking to existing information in my database. It's helpful to motivate yourself to add additional context that might help 'future you' find the information later on.

There might be an initial temptation to create templates for everything; most people like the idea of automating things as much as possible. While Logseq is flexible and creating templates is easy, it's important to identify your actual pain points and use templates to solve those.

## Some template basics

- You create a template by selecting the block (or sets of blocks, as long as they are indented under one parent), right clicking on the bullet point, and selecting `Make template`.
- To use the template, use the forward slash key `/`, scroll to `Template` (or type `tem` and scroll down using the arrow keys), and select the template that you want to use.
- It's helpful to create and store your templates in a `[[templates]]` page in your database. That way, if you want to edit a template, you know exactly where to navigate to, rather than having to query your database to find all your templates.
  - That query is helpful to know though:
        
        {{query property template}}
