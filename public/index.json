[{"content":"Introduction Logseq and Obsidian are two of the most popular note-taking tools on the market, helping users manage their personal information in a more structured and efficient way, all in a single interface. This blog post will provide an in-depth comparison of the two tools, highlighting their similarities, differences, and strengths, and ultimately highlight why I chose Logseq over Obsidian.\nSome quick disclaimers: this post doesn\u0026rsquo;t get into the details of personal knowledge management or the workings and benefits of linked databases. Instead, the focus will be on providing a clear comparison of Logseq and Obsidian. As a seasoned Logseq user with over two years of experience, I must also acknowledge that I have a natural affinity for the tool. While I have experimented with Obsidian occasionally during this period, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t classify myself as an expert. I also offer a personal knowledge management course using Logseq, which creates a financial incentive to recommend Logseq. This is a potential conflict of interest that I want to be transparent about.\nWith all that out the way, it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to look at how the tools are similar to provide a point of departure for the comparison.\nSimilarities between the tools Fundamental concepts: Both Logseq and Obsidian are built on graph databases that utilise bi-directional linking to create connections between different pieces of information. They share a similar hypertext-style interface that enables users to access information quickly by clicking on links. File storage: Both Logseq and Obsidian prioritise local-first storage, whilst offering a \u0026lsquo;Sync\u0026rsquo; option to support multi-device usage. They both work on a backend of Markdown files stored locally on your computer (Logseq also supports OrgMode text files). To access Logseq Sync, you can contribute a minimum of $5 per month on the Open Collective platform. Obsidian Sync is available through the Obsidian website at a cost of $10 per month. Operating systems and mobile apps: Both Logseq and Obsidian support Windows, Linux, and macOS, and they both have mobile apps for iOS and Android. However, you must download the Android app for Logseq from GitHub, as it is not available on the Google Play store. Transclusion of information: (references and embeds) Both tools enable you to display or embed original content from one location within another location, with a direct reference to the source material. Extensibility: Both Logseq and Obsidian have a robust plugin environment that allows users to add custom features on top of the base feature set. Community: Both tools have large communities on Discord, providing helpful resources for users to discuss their workflows and troubleshoot challenges. Pricing: Both tools are free forever for personal use. There are are some features which can be purchased on a subscription basis (e.g., Obsidian has a Publish feature which is discussed further on) Given the numerous similarities, one might wonder why users tend to have strong preferences for one tool over the other. There is one key difference that divides opinion. Before we get there, it is important to acknowledge a common objection raised in comparisons between the tools. Obsidian users often point to the availability of plugins to achieve similar functionality for features in Logseq. The focus of this post is on the \u0026lsquo;out-of-the-box\u0026rsquo; functionality, which is how most new users typically engage with these tools.\nThe major difference between the tools Logseq is a block-based outliner, allowing you to organise information into a tree-like structure using bullet-points. You can think of it as a mind-map, but for text. This allows users to quickly structure and add hierarchy to their information by indenting information, and to also move quickly between different branches of information.\nUsers can collapse and expand indented blocks, hiding information they\u0026rsquo;re not working on and therefore don\u0026rsquo;t need to see. You can also zoom into and out of different levels quickly, to focus on only the content that you want to work with. Blocks can also be easily moved around the user interface by dragging and dropping using the mouse, or by using keyboard shortcuts.\nAnother crucial aspect of outliners is the inheritance of linked relationships. When a block is indented underneath another block that has links or tags, the indented block will inherit all those relationships. Rather than relying on folders for organising information, you can use a top-level block with a tag, and store related information in blocks indented beneath it. This approach provides a streamlined method for organising information and retrieving it efficiently, without the friction of questioning \u0026ldquo;where do I store it?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;where do I go to find it?\u0026rdquo;.\nIn contrast to the outliner approach, Obsidian is a page-based application that functions like a long-form text editor, similar to a Microsoft Word document. The key advantage over traditional word processors is the instant searchability of all files and folders, as well as seamless linking between different pieces of information.\nThe benefit of the block-based approach over the page-based approach may appear trivial to some, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found it to be an impossible gap to bridge in Obsidian. To my earlier point, Obsidian can accomplish some of Logseq\u0026rsquo;s outliner functionality using plugins, but it is not primarily an outliner at its core. However, Obsidian does have some major benefits over Logseq.\nObsidian\u0026rsquo;s major benefits Markdown compatibility: Whilst Logseq uses Markdown files, they are not 100% compatible with other programs. Logseq strips out blank lines and doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for multiple headings in a single block. If you collapse your high level blocks, you\u0026rsquo;ll also be presented with collapsed:: true metadata through your database. Obsidian uses \u0026lsquo;vanilla\u0026rsquo; markdown. This makes it excellent for long form writing and ease of publishing. In fact, I edited the final version of this post in Obsidian once I\u0026rsquo;d stripped away the outlines.\nSpeed / performance: One of the major benefits of using Obsidian is its speed. Indexing your graph and navigating to different pages is lightning quick. This was demonstrated in the speed test conducted at the beginning of last year by Alexander Rink, which showed that Obsidian was able to import a large number of files in just a few seconds. Additionally, navigating between pages and using the graph view in Obsidian is also quicker than Logseq. Importing files into different TfTs - Alexander Rink, Jan 2022.\nPage-based model offers familiarity: For those accustomed to files and folders (most people, really) Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s interface allows you to stick to that paradigm, whilst introducing powerful database features.\nExtensive plugin environment: There is a plugin for almost every requirement, and users can even combine plugins to create tailored workflows. This flexibility enables individuals to customise their experience according to their needs. Another key distinction compared to Logseq is the differentiation of \u0026lsquo;Core\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Community\u0026rsquo; plugins. Core plugins receive support from Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s development team, ensuring their ongoing maintenance and optimal performance. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t diminish the value of Community plugins, which can also be excellent additions.\nHighly customisable nature: For those well-versed in the Obsidian environment, the possibilities for configuration are endless.\nSide note: This level of customisation can also be seen as a drawback. Content creators using Obsidian often have unique configurations, which can cause confusion for others. Certain functionality only works in certain themes, which impacts the resilience of the program. The individual plugins each have their own custom settings, which can lead to an overwhelming number of options to navigate and consider. Performant graph view: The graph view in Obsidian is more refined than Logseq, and also quicker to navigate. Users can customise their graph view\u0026rsquo;s appearance by adjusting colours, node sizes, link styles, and more to suit their preferences. In general, Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s graph view feels more usable than Logseq\u0026rsquo;s.\nIn-house \u0026lsquo;Publish\u0026rsquo; feature: Many PKM users require solutions for publishing their databases as online wikis or knowledge bases. Obsidian has an in-house publishing solution available for $8/month to meet their needs.\nLarger user base and community: Having a larger community means you\u0026rsquo;ll find more plugins to choose from, more content creators to help you maximise your use of the tool, and also more people on the forum to lend a hand if you need help or advice.\nObsidian clearly has a few feathers in its cap, and it\u0026rsquo;s sizeable user base is justified. Despite this, Logseq brings a unique set of advantages to the table in addition to being an outliner, making it an attractive option in its own right.\nLogseq\u0026rsquo;s major benefits More native functionality \u0026lsquo;out of the box\u0026rsquo;: Logseq has basic query and task management functionality built-in to the application. The interface also allows users to easily access linked references at the bottom of the main and side panels—a handy feature in a linked database. Open-source development: Logseq is an open-source project. Although there is a core development team driving the majority of development, you can still contribute to the development of the application. This also ensures longevity of the application. If the development team were to disappear overnight, one would still be able to download the latest version of Logseq from GitHub (and theoretically create a fork if you\u0026rsquo;d like to continue the development) Enablement of block-based workflows: I think it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to again emphasise the merits of block-based workflows for those who may skim through the article. Outliners provide a streamlined tool to quickly input and organise information for efficient retrieval later. They allow you to deal with multiple levels of context at a time, quickly expanding, collapsing or focusing in on a particular set of blocks. They also allow for easy navigation and manipulation of information in a hierarchy. More intuitive user interface: Logseq\u0026rsquo;s interface can be considered more intuitive due to its consistent appearance across various themes. The interface features a left sidebar for navigation and \u0026ldquo;Favourite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Recent\u0026rdquo; pages, and two panels for accessing information with the main panel and the right sidebar. Additionally, Logseq\u0026rsquo;s linked references are easier to navigate. Regardless of the panel you are using, there is always a clear visual indication of the source of the information (via breadcrumbs) or linked content. Opinionated \u0026ldquo;journal first\u0026rdquo; approach: While this may seem like a small detail, it encourages a new way of working where you begin with your daily journal as a starting point and use it as a \u0026lsquo;scratch pad\u0026rsquo;. Every time you open Logseq, you are greeted with your daily journal page by default. This feature mimics a physical A5 annual calendar, making it easy to jot down your thoughts quickly without worrying about where to store them. You can then organise them for efficient future retrieval by adding hierarchy and linking. This approach helps users enhance their workflows over time. Verdict: Why I chose Logseq over Obsidian Both Obsidian and Logseq offer a diverse range of features that make them excellent tools for personal knowledge management. Ultimately, personal preference will play a significant role in determining the ideal tool for you. It is *personal* knowledge management, after all.\nFor me, Logseq\u0026rsquo;s outliner DNA provides a familiar interface and powerful functionality. I started my personal knowledge management journey using Roam Research, a block-based outliner similar to Logseq. It became too expensive to justify given my limited understanding at the time, so I started looking for a replacement.\nI found Obsidian first, but didn\u0026rsquo;t grasp the way it worked. I was looking for the familiar feel of Roam Research, which by that point I\u0026rsquo;d spent a few months getting to grips with. I was also confused by the local storage of files, as Roam Research was a cloud-based web-app.\nBut then I discovered Logseq, and it bridged the two worlds for me, seamlessly merging an outliner application with local storage. Most importantly, it worked out of the box, offering powerful, (fairly) beginner-friendly functionality without the need for plugins and customisation. After about a month, I was hooked, and the rest is history.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that this isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;winner-takes-all\u0026rdquo; comparison. Both tools have their strengths, and if you can\u0026rsquo;t decide, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to use both tools simultaneously, as they work on the same backend of Markdown files. However, to reap greater long-term benefits, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to select one tool and use it consistently.\nUltimately, the goal is to develop a robust and personalised knowledge management system to support you, and the real trick is to get started sooner than later. I wish you the best of luck.\nFurther resources on Logseq vs Obsidian How to get started in Logseq - analogue model of blocks and pages Battle Royale: Obsidian vs Logseq - Which is Better? TfT Performance: Interim Results Quick Tip: Outlining in Obsidian Obsidian plugins you can use to mimic Logseq I have been cautious in my adoption of plugins. Logseq has this disclaimer when you activate plugins:\nPlugins can access your graph and your local files, issue network requests. They can also cause data corruption or loss. We\u0026rsquo;re working on proper access rules for your graphs. Meanwhile, make sure you have regular backups of your graphs and only install the plugins when you can read and understand the source code.\nThe same is true for Obisidian. Plugins introduce a third-party risk, so you need to do your own homework. This is not meant to scare anyone. There are some trusted, credible plugin developers across both communities, although it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to consider the risks. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for some plugins to help achieve a similar Logseq feel in Obsidian, here are some that might help:\nOutline Outliner (separate to above) Zoom Backlinks Outgoing links Strange New Worlds Disclaimer: This post was written with the help of a number of tools that use AI. First, I added my original YouTube video to Readwise\u0026rsquo;s Reader application. Readwise generates a transcript from this video, which I then export to a Markdown file. I process the text in Quillbot\u0026rsquo;s online tool to paraphrase and remove some of the parsing errors I get from Readwise. I then ask ChatGPT to summarise my thoughts, which I then use as the starting point for this post. It still takes a lot of effort (over a day this case!) to get it up to the standard that I\u0026rsquo;d like, but it\u0026rsquo;s a great point of departure. The full video is available below.

I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to account for this in my pricing, keeping prices low so that cost doesn\u0026rsquo;t become the main obstacle. Nevertheless, a \u0026lsquo;one-size-fits-all\u0026rsquo; approach to pricing isn\u0026rsquo;t feasible in a global economy, which is why I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to implement purchasing power parity (PPP) pricing for Logseq Mastery.\nHow PPP pricing work? Purchasing power parity (PPP) pricing is an economic concept that considers the purchasing power of currencies in their local countries, rather than relying solely on market exchange rates. Economists use price data to compare the cost of goods and services in each country, and then normalise them based on a single currency exchange rate, typically the US dollar. The relative purchasing power of each currency is then determined by comparing this normalised cost across countries.\nOne index which has become popular is the Big Mac Index, developed by The Economist. The index works by converting a country\u0026rsquo;s local Big Mac price into US dollars to determine if a currency is over- or under-valued. The pricing discrepancy also reveals the relative PPP.\nFor example, taking my home country, South Africa, and using the July 2022 dataset, the price for a Big Mac is R39.90. This equates to $2.34, applying the exchange rate at the time of R17.04/ $. In the US, a Big Mac costs $5.15. This implies that the South Africa Rand has 45% purchasing power of the US dollar (2.34/5.15), and that prices should be reduced to take account for that.\nThe Big Mac Index is obviously a simplified way of analysing currency values, as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t account for differences in production costs, taxes, and other factors impacting Big Mac prices globally. Even so, it serves as a useful benchmark for simple applications.\nHow do I plan to implement it? There is an excellent SaaS called Parity Deals that integrates with course hosting platforms and offers users a discount banner based on their IP address. Of course, all of this comes with an ongoing cost at a time that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to limit my number of SaaS subscriptions.\nSo, inspired by Marie Poulin, I\u0026rsquo;ve chose to experiment with my own version for a few months, which gives me the added benefit of seeing how the discounts are applied. I combined the World Bank\u0026rsquo;s PPP dataset and the Economist\u0026rsquo;s Big Mac index to create a database of different countries and their discount eligibility. Users can register for a discount via an Airtable form, and upon approval will receive an email with the discount code and a link to a special landing page.\nThis is a trial solution, and I welcome user feedback. I may end up defaulting to Parity Deals in the future.\nAn appeal for good faith While the ParityDeals.com service might be vulnerable to IP spoofing, I\u0026rsquo;m susceptible to dishonesty from people in high-income countries who possess passports or documentation from low-income countries. I\u0026rsquo;ve already had an instance of this, which I only discovered because the person specifically asked me if they could trial the approach, but then added the country where they\u0026rsquo;re currently residing in the sign-out form. While there may have been other reasons behind this, it was nonetheless disheartening. As I navigate this new pricing structure, I kindly ask potential users to respect the purpose behind PPP pricing and act in good faith.\nConclusion I hope that implementing PPP pricing for Logseq Mastery will make the course more accessible, and look forward to including a more global audience in the course. While the current trial solution has its limitations, I will be improving the process based on user feedback, so please reach out if you have any feedback.\nView PPP pricing eligibility Register for a PPP discount\n","permalink":"https://blog.logseqmastery.com/post/introducing-purchasing-power-parity-pricing/","summary":"Logseq Mastery now has purchasing power parity (PPP) pricing to make the course more accessible to a global audience.","title":"Introducing purchasing power parity pricing to Logseq Mastery"},{"content":"Browse the table below to see if your country of residence is eligible for a discount Register for a PPP discount If you believe that I should re-consider the data for your country, please let me know at \u0026lsquo;dario\u0026rsquo; at \u0026lsquo;combiningminds\u0026rsquo; dot \u0026lsquo;org\u0026rsquo;.\n","permalink":"https://blog.logseqmastery.com/ppp-pricing-eligibility/","summary":"Logseq Mastery now has purchasing power parity (PPP) pricing to make the course more accessible to a global audience.","title":"Purchasing power parity pricing eligibility"},{"content":"Introduction and quick start I recently discovered the power of custom CSS in Logseq and have found it to be an invaluable addition to my database. The visual changes not only make it more aesthetically pleasing, but also provide subtle cues that encourage interaction with the information in your database.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve shared my custom CSS here as a quick start reference. To install this CSS, follow these steps:\nCopy the code from the GitHub page linked above Open your \u0026lsquo;Settings\u0026rsquo; menu in Logseq (this can be accessed using the shortcut \u0026rsquo;t s\u0026rsquo;) Click the \u0026lsquo;Edit custom.css\u0026rsquo; button Paste the code into the code editor Voilà, you\u0026rsquo;re all set! For those interested in making updates to the CSS, I\u0026rsquo;ll delve into more detail below, as it\u0026rsquo;s useful to understand what you\u0026rsquo;re working with.\nA (slightly) deeper dive into CSS Identifying CSS elements (selectors) The first step is know the type of element you want to modify in Logseq. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll examine two simple elements: #tags and [[page references]].\nTo update the appearance of #tags, use the following:\n.tag{ }.content To update the appearance of [[page references]], use the following:\n.page-reference{ }.content Specifying text You can further refine the elements that you want to change by specifying text in the [data-ref] parameter.\nIf you have a tag, #target, or page reference, [[target]], you would use the following code:\n.tag[data-ref=\u0026quot;target\u0026quot;]{ }.content and\n.page-reference[data-ref=\u0026quot;target\u0026quot;]{ }.content Identifying patterns of text You can also define different positions of target text in the [data-ref] parameter. In the examples below, we will look at some patterns which will work for the word \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;:\nTo target an element that begins with specific characters, use the ^ sign. For example, if the element value is \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;, use:\n[data-ref^=\u0026quot;tar\u0026quot;] To target an element that ends with specific characters, use the $ sign. For example, if the element value is \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;, use:\n[data-ref$=\u0026quot;get\u0026quot;] To target an element that contains a substring of certain characters, use the * sign. For example, if the element value is \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo;, use:\n[data-ref*=\u0026quot;rg\u0026quot;] Using different CSS properties CSS allows you to alter the visual appearance by modifying different properties, such as colours, spacing and font-size. Some common properties are listed below, but if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a comprehensive guide, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs is the place to go.\n{ color:; background-color: padding: ; border-radius:; margin:; font-weight; }.content Adhering to CSS best practices If you refer to this this handy CSS reference, also from the Mozilla Developer Network, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that my approach doesn\u0026rsquo;t follow best practices. I\u0026rsquo;ve condensed all my CSS parameters onto a single line, rather than using multiple lines. However, I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied with the outcome for my purposes, and it simplifies editing my work.\nBest practice would suggest that instead of this:\na.tag[data-ref=\u0026quot;target\u0026quot;]{ padding:0 7px; border-radius:7px; margin:2px 0; color:white !important; background-color:grey}.content I should use this\na.tag[data-ref=\u0026quot;target\u0026quot;]{ padding:0 7px; border-radius:7px; margin:2px 0; color:white !important; background-color:grey }.content Conclusion Visual enhancements to your personal knowledge management tool of choice should not be taken for granted. If it improves your experience, it will likely improve your utilisation of the tool too. Now it\u0026rsquo;s your turn to experiment with custom CSS and unleash your inner artist in your Logseq database. Happy customising!\nIf you found this post helpful, you might enjoy the full Logseq Mastery course.

In this post I break down a simple way to implement CSS in your database.","title":"Adding custom CSS to your Logseq database"},{"content":"What are queries? A query is a way to ask your database questions. You can use queries to search for backlinks (and tags - these are interchangeable in Logseq), blocks with user-defined properties, text snippets, date-based information and different management task statuses and priorities. Queries are particularly useful when looking for a combination of information, as you can use Boolean operators to refine your results. They can be thought of as saved searches. The \u0026ldquo;questions\u0026rdquo; remain as a block in your database, which means you can return to the query when you need to ask the same questions.\nWhy use queries at all? Queries are useful for building dashboards for your most repeatable workflows, for example, project and task management dashboards. They also create accessible searches when you require ease of reference in a particular location in your database. Queries are the easiest way to find text quickly in your database, rather than using \u0026lsquo;Unlinked references\u0026rsquo;. Finally, they are a great tool for building indexes of information, particularly when you have used properties consistently in your database.\nWhat is returned by a query? Queries return a subset of blocks that match your input criteria. Looking at the simplest example of a [[backlink]], a query will return the following:\nAll blocks linked to [[backlink]] (i.e. [[backlink]] appears in the block) All blocks indented below a block linked to [[backlink]] All blocks on the [[backlink]] page How to use queries in Logseq The standard way of bringing up a query is using the / command to bring up the context menu. Then type query. It will automatically input the standard query format {{query }}. You can then enter a number of parameters to refine what is returned by your query.\nUser-defined properties: {{query (property property_name property_value) }} property_name is the property that you have defined. My typical examples are type::, producer::, etc. property_value is optional. You can use normal text or [[backlinks]] Text snippets: {{query \u0026ldquo;search text in quotation marks\u0026rdquo;}} Date-based information: {{query (between start end)}} start and end can be either dates from the journal, e.g. [[Jan 1st, 2023]], natural language, e.g. yesterday or the built-in operators + and - with time frames min for minutes, h for hours, d for days, w for weeks, m for months and y for years Task statuses: {{query (task task_status)}} task_status can be later, todo, now, doing, waiting, cancelled or done. Priorities: {{query (priority priority_level)}} priority_level can be either A, B, or C. How does Boolean logic work? The image below is taken from Logseq Mastery where there is a full video dedicated to this topic. However, the second video linked below also explains this diagram in detail.\nHelpful tips when working with queries Include a user-friendly description of what you are trying to query in a block above your actual query. You can then indent the main query under that high-level block. This is like building documentation into your database and helps you remember what you were trying to do. Text queries are particularly valuable when searching for information in your database that you haven\u0026rsquo;t linked to, rather than using Unlinked References. Note that text queries are case sensitive. Avoid queries that will return too many blocks, as this will slow down Logseq\u0026rsquo;s performance. When you have a query, it returns a long list of all the blocks. It is often helpful to pivot those results into a table for easy readability. This feature becomes particularly powerful if you\u0026rsquo;ve used properties consistently.

Omnivore is an open-source read-it-later application that allows users to save and organise online content (e.g., tweets, articles, and blog posts) for later reading and reference.\nMany people in the tools for thought community use ReadWise\u0026rsquo;s Reader app as their preferred read-it-later app. It is an excellent product, which I still use for some workflows (see disclaimer below). But there was one issue that led me to search for an alternative solution. Reader can only export your highlights and annotations to a page, and not at a block level. This approach doesn\u0026rsquo;t suit my reading workflow or the way I manage information in my database.\nIn my database, notes on articles, videos, podcasts, and tweets are small chunks of information that don\u0026rsquo;t warrant their own pages. The proliferation of pages resulting from Readwise imports was not to my liking. Having an excessive number of pages can also affect Logseq\u0026rsquo;s performance, although it has improved significantly lately. I knew this was something I wanted to avoid, and for some time, I had been using hacky workarounds with Reader, exporting to Markdown and laboriously copy-pasting into Logseq. However, I found myself avoiding this workflow— even avoiding reading in Reader— because I knew the frustration it would cause later.\nAnd then I found Omnivore.\nOr rather, Omnivore found me. The Omnivore team actually reached out to me to tell me about the app the day after I joined Reader as a beta user. I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy switching applications on a whim, so I wanted to give Reader a fair chance and politely declined the invitation to try out Omnivore.\nA few months later, the team reached out to me again to see if there was anything they could learn from my Readwise workflow. We scheduled a call, and this time I saw the app working first-hand. I noticed how Omnivore utilised the same content-as-blocks paradigm, and it was evident that my reading and processing workflow would work perfectly in Omnivore without the need for workarounds.\nOmnivore is mobile-friendly, a non-negotiable in this space, with both iOS and Android apps. (I prefer to use the progressive web app because the official application defaults to dark mode, and I prefer reading dark text on a light background.) The user interface is minimalistic and visually appealing. The ability to create an email alias that lets you subscribe to online publications is also a basic requirement in read-it-later apps, and setting this up in Omnivore is straightforward.\nSince I started using Omnivore, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself reading more and retaining more information. The seamless integration with Logseq is a major benefit, and the team has been great to interact with, which is always a bonus. If you\u0026rsquo;re someone who takes a lot of notes as you read, I recommend giving Omnivore a try. It\u0026rsquo;s become an integral part of my workflow, and I\u0026rsquo;m confident it will be a great addition to yours.\nIntegrating Logseq and Omnivore Brian Sunter has written a handy guide to getting started with Omnivore here, but I\u0026rsquo;ll break down the basics below.\nYou first need to create an Omnivore account via their website. I also recommend that you install the browser extension. Here is the link to the Chrome browser extension. Install the Omnivore plugin in the Logseq marketplace, then navigate to your plugin settings. Three dot menu at top right of screen -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Plugins\u0026rdquo; on left panel -\u0026gt; Select \u0026ldquo;Omnivore\u0026rdquo; Go back to your Omnivore web app and create an API key by clicking on your user profile at the top right of your screen, and selecting \u0026ldquo;API keys\u0026rdquo; Copy this API key and paste it into your settings in the relevant box in your Omnivore plugin settings in Logseq. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve added some articles, you can then activate the Omnivore import by clicking the plugin icon at the top of your screen. My basic workflow for using Omnivore Save all sources to Omnivore wep-app Omnivore has a simple browser plugin that allows you to add articles at the click of a button or by using shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + O\u0026rdquo; You can submit tweets to Omnivore by using the iOS or Android apps and using the \u0026ldquo;Share Tweet via\u0026rdquo; context menu. I do most of my reading on my tablet and make highlights and annotations about what I\u0026rsquo;ve read as I go along. If once I\u0026rsquo;ve finished reading a source, I decide I want to send it to Logseq, I add my custom label \u0026ldquo;Sent to Logseq\u0026rdquo; and then I archive the source using the standard \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; shortcut. (Note: this works for Reader, Gmail, and many other programmes.) If I haven\u0026rsquo;t highlighted anything or taken any notes, I simply archive the source. When I want to import my Omnivore notes into Logseq, I click the Omnivore Plugin button in Logseq, which imports all the articles that I\u0026rsquo;ve labelled \u0026ldquo;Sent to Logseq\u0026rdquo; to a page in my database called \u0026ldquo;Omnivore imports\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve setup a custom filter in my Omnivore plugin settings by changing the filter to \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; and then only importing those articles that have the label “Sent to Logseq”. I do this to avoid all the articles syncing to Logseq, even if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read them. When I want to process an article in my database, I move that article to the journal page for the current day. I then clean up my notes and add tags to the parent-level block that will help me find the article again. If I needed to tag something that the tag in the parent-level block didn\u0026rsquo;t cover, I would tag blocks at the individual level. Why do I follow this approach? This approach helps me keep track of what I\u0026rsquo;ve processed. I treat it like a Kanban board for reading, where the three columns are as follows:\nsynced to be read later -\u0026gt; read and annotated -\u0026gt; processed in my database. I\u0026rsquo;ve also configured my import settings to enable me to distinguish between what is others\u0026rsquo; writing (i.e. highlights) and what are my notes. Highlights are turned into a Markdown quotation block by adding a \u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot; in front of the block. My notes on the block are then indented underneath the highlighted snippet, although I often remove the original highlight and just leave my own notes.\nAll my templates are shared below so that you can implement this workflow if it sounds good to you.\nMy Omnivore plugin settings Note that I created the \u0026ldquo;Sent to Logseq\u0026rdquo; label in the Omnivore interface. I only add the label to articles that I want to send to Logseq.\nAlso note that the implementation of the advanced filter has also changed since I released the video.\nNow, instead of this format in the advanced filter box\u0026hellip;\nlabel:\\\u0026quot;Sent to Logseq\\\u0026quot; you should use this format:\nlabel:\u0026quot;Sent to Logseq\u0026quot; Article template text: ### {{{title}}} collapsed:: true {{#author}} producer:: [[{{{author}}}]] {{/author}} input:: [[articles]] link:: {{{originalUrl}}} source:: [[Omnivore imports]] tags:: Here is the full YouTube video for reference: Disclaimer: This post was written with the help of a number of tools that use AI. First, I added my original YouTube video to Readwise\u0026rsquo;s Reader application. Readwise generates a transcript from this video, which I then export to a Markdown file. I process the text in Quillbot\u0026rsquo;s online tool to paraphrase and remove some of the parsing errors I get from Readwise. I then ask ChatGPT to summarise my thoughts, which I then use as the starting point for this post. It still takes a lot of effort to get it up to the standard that I\u0026rsquo;d like, but it\u0026rsquo;s a great point of departure.\nIf you found this post helpful, you might enjoy the full Logseq Mastery course.

Creating templates requires minimal upfront effort, and they\u0026rsquo;re a great way to build consistency in your database and reduce the friction of input. By using a few simple keystrokes to access a template, you save time instead of repeatedly typing out information, or copying and pasting it from a reference document.\nWhat makes for a good template? A good template is one that you\u0026rsquo;ll use frequently (i.e., almost every day), or that will save you significant time when you need to use it infrequently.\nAnother good use of templates is to prompt your thinking. If you\u0026rsquo;re writing a report, for example, you might have a series of question prompts that ensure you achieve all the deliverables.\nTemplates can also be a forcing mechanism to help you link your knowledge. For example, my template for articles has a property for tags:: which ensures that I don\u0026rsquo;t skip the work of linking to existing information in my database. It\u0026rsquo;s helpful to motivate yourself to add additional context that might help \u0026lsquo;future you\u0026rsquo; find the information later on.\nThere might be an initial temptation to create templates for everything; most people like the idea of automating things as much as possible. While Logseq is flexible and creating templates is easy, it\u0026rsquo;s important to identify your actual pain points and use templates to solve those.\nSome template basics You create a template by selecting the block (or sets of blocks, as long as they are indented under one parent), right clicking on the bullet point, and selecting Make template. To use the template, use the forward slash key /, scroll to Template (or type tem and scroll down using the arrow keys), and select the template that you want to use. It\u0026rsquo;s helpful to create and store your templates in a [[templates]] page in your database. That way, if you want to edit a template, you know exactly where to navigate to, rather than having to query your database to find all your templates. That query is helpful to know though:\n{{query property template}} Here are some videos I created on templates: If you found this post helpful, you might enjoy the full Logseq Mastery course. Templates are only a small part of using Logseq effectively. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to level-up quickly in Logseq, then Logseq Mastery for you.

Namespaces are a helpful feature in Logseq for those who like top-down approaches to information management. Namespaces are characters that allow for the addition of hierarchy in a file system.\nSuppose the example a hierarchical folder structure in Windows Explorer. If you navigate to a particular folder and then click on the folder \u0026lsquo;breadcrumbs\u0026rsquo;, you\u0026rsquo;ll see something like this: C:\\Users\\YourName\\Downloads . In this example, the namespace character is a backslash \\ and it indicates a branch of a higher root folder.\nHow are namespaces implemented in Logseq? In Logseq, namespaces are a special type of page that allow for hierarchy in the page names. The namespaces character in Logseq is a forward slash, /.\nFor example, I would like to take notes on different Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) related information and add some hierarchy to my notes. Hypothetically, I learn about a new choke, the \u0026rsquo;triangle\u0026rsquo;. I could then create a page [[BJJ/chokes/triangle]]. If I try a new gym, I might want to keep track of all the people that I meet there, so I create a page [[BJJ/gyms/Renzo Gracie Cape Town]]. Logseq will create a Markdown file for each new namespace page you create. In the actual file name, the / is replaced by %2F. So the files created above would be BJJ%2Fchokes%2Ftriangle.md and BJJ%2Fgyms%2FRenzo Gracie Cape Town.md\nWhilst namespaces do create hierarchy in your database, the implementation differs slightly from traditional folders. It\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that all pages serve as nodes in your database. Namespaces can therefore perform two functions:\nNamespace pages can store information. Namespaces can be used as a node by which to create links to blocks in your database for easier retrieval. So if I meet someone new in the gym, Marcelo Garcia (I wish\u0026hellip;), I could enter that information in one of two ways. I can enter a block on my daily journal and link that block to the gym (see below), or I could navigate to the page and enter Marcelo Garcia as an actual block on that page.\nMarcelo Garcia [[BJJ/gyms/Renzo Gracie Cape Town]] The utility of namespaces Namespaces\u0026rsquo; are particularly useful in retrieving information. They provide you with access to a new panel below your Linked References to navigate namespaces. However, you can also create namespace queries to generate automatically updating indices for your content. This is my preferred approach.\nFor example, I could generate a list of all my BJJ-related content with the query {{namespace BJJ}}. The output from my personal database appears as below, which enables me to easily navigate all the BJJ-related content in my database.\nWhen you first use Logseq it might be tempting to use namespaces for everything. This can lead to headaches later on, however, as imposing a rigid top-down structure from the beginning limits your flexibility. I\u0026rsquo;d encourage you to delay your use of namespaces until you have refined your understanding of how they might suit your workflows.\nIf you found this post helpful, you might enjoy the full Logseq Mastery course.

It is re-published with permission.\nThe ‘tools for thought’ space has exploded in the last few years. Tools such as Roam Research, Obsidian, RemNote, and even Notion allow users to manage their digital information in ways previously only accessible to hackers.\nDespite this fierce competition, Logseq has emerged from humble beginnings to take its place as a leader in the field. I believe this is mainly because Logseq has three separate tools built into its DNA: a text editor, an outliner, and a bi-directional linking tool.\nWhilst other tools may rely on plugins to achieve some of the functionality (e.g. the Outliner plugin in Obsidian), Logseq was designed from the bottom up to be a combination of the three. This makes Logseq a proper \u0026lsquo;integrated thinking environment\u0026rsquo; (ITE); that is an “app that provides tools to make thinking easier, enabling us to be more innovative.\u0026quot; (Ryan Murphy).\nAnd no, an ITE is not another fancy acronym for ‘tool for thought’. Whilst all ITEs will invariably be ‘tools for thought’, the inverse is not valid. For example, a white-boarding application is a ‘tool for thought’ but not an ITE. An ITE goes beyond a single function, providing an all-in-one graphical user interface (GUI) to manage information, thereby facilitating improved thinking and original output. We’ll look into what differentiates an ITE later, but I’m sure there are a few eyebrows raised. Isn’t this just a solution, waiting for a problem?\nWhy do we even need an \u0026lsquo;integrated thinking environment\u0026rsquo;? It’s easy to dismiss the explosion of users switching to these new tools as hype. Technical terms like ‘bi-directional linking’ are difficult to grasp, and sales pitches aspiring to create a ‘worldwide connected knowledge graph’ sound aloof.\nMost people don’t have the time or energy to explore outside their current toolset, and the new ways of working required by these tools can be an obstacle to adoption. And so, the average knowledge worker will continue juggling their current suite of applications, despite the shortcomings.\nThe question therefore arises, is there substance behind the hype? And why should I care about Logseq (or any other ITE, for that matter)?\nConsider the example of the highly technical field of web development and software engineering. ‘Integrated development environments’ (IDEs) are a core tool in the developer’s toolkit. These IDEs provide an all-in-one GUI that consolidates the different aspects of writing code to solve complex problems. This includes editing source code, automatic syntax highlighting, debugging tools and workflow automation. Our modern technical infrastructure would be a few years (decades?) behind if it weren’t for the humble IDE. It’s a simple tool that facilitates complex problem-solving.\nConsider now an array of other roles in the knowledge work economy. Our knowledge lies scattered across a range of applications. Tasks and reminders, reference documents, processes, meeting notes, ideas and overall project objectives are all scattered across apps and devices. Our information is typically stored in proprietary formats, only accessible via JSON exports (if we\u0026rsquo;ve chosen our application wisely). In an age where we create value by transforming knowledge, there are numerous friction points we need to overcome. We constantly incur switching costs as we access and process fragmented information to produce original output.\nImagine an alternate reality where you have all your information in one place, in an accessible user interface. Your files are stored in a simple text format that can be accessed by any application capable of reading text. You can jot down random reminders or write your magnum opus using outlines. Your information is densely linked, making it easier to find what you’re looking for and generate new connections. That is the world of the integrated thinking environment, the ITE.\nI believe ITEs will be standard tools in the knowledge worker’s toolkit in years to come. I’d bet a fair sum that Logseq will be a leading name in the ITE space, just like VS Code and IntelliJ are highly regarded IDEs for coders. We’ll look at what an ITE should be able to do later in the article, but first, I’d like to take a closer look at each of the three tools built into Logseq’s DNA: text editor, outliner and a bi-directional linking tool.\nLogseq as a text editor Logseq allows you to work on text files in Markdown format. Markdown is a popular plain text format, like the .txt files that work with Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS. The difference is that Markdown allows us to add formatting to plain text using special characters. For example, if I want to bold some words, I would simply add double asterisks before and after the words, e.g. **some words**.\nMarkdown is widely adopted and easy to use; even Google Docs is expanding its support of Markdown. The Markdown text files, recognised by the ‘.md’ file extension, are stored in the location of your choice (e.g. a folder on your desktop). This goes against the trend of modern note-taking and information management applications such as Roam Research, Notion and Evernote, which host your information on their own cloud databases.\nWith Logseq, you can still decide to host your notes on the cloud using a provider like iCloud or Google Drive, but you have complete privacy and portability because you own the files. You can open your files in any other text-editing application, and there is no risk of lock-in.\nLogseq as an outliner An outliner is a specialised text editor that allows you to organise your text in a branching, tree-like structure. Think of it as a mind map, but with text. Branches are achieved by indentation, using Tab to indent and Shift-Tab to unindent. This allows you to structure your notes quickly.\nYou can structure your tree of notes as simply or as complex as needed. You can collapse and expand indented blocks, hiding information that you\u0026rsquo;re not working on and don\u0026rsquo;t need to see. You can also zoom into and out of different levels of information quickly, focusing on only the blocks of content that you are working on.\nA demo of Logseq\u0026rsquo;s powerful outlining features Outliners further allow you to sequence information easily. You can move blocks of information up or down (in addition to left and right via indenting) while preserving the structure of the information you are moving and the surrounding information.\nThe graphic below illustrates how the outline structure transforms into branches of notes. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon discover how the branching within an outline allows you to focus on one thing at a time whilst still allowing for that smaller unit to form part of a greater whole. This is what is meant by the word \u0026lsquo;atomicity\u0026rsquo;.\nLogseq as a bi-directional linking tool Logseq’s primary drawcard is that it makes linking information easy. Bi-directional links provide a simple yet powerful feature set to add relationships between different notes in your note database at both the macro (page) and micro (block or paragraph) levels.\nWhat makes bi-directional links so powerful is the creation of so-called \u0026lsquo;back-links\u0026rsquo; in the page or block that is being referenced. When a link to a target is created at some source, another link is created in the target location, which points back to the original source. That means I can go to a page and see all the times that other pages have linked to it. This becomes a powerful way to collect your thoughts and information. You no longer have to navigate to a particular file to input information - you can input information anywhere in your database and easily retrieve it.\nBi-directional links also allow you to add multiple links to a single block, thereby building multiple associations to the information. How does this help our brains? Our brains are good at remembering things by association. The ‘Baker-baker’ paradox is a psychological phenomenon where a group of subjects find it easier to remember the keyword—baker— associated with a person when told that the person’s profession is ‘baker’, rather than their surname being ‘Baker’. This is because the profession of baker has many different associations in our minds. A network of thoughts already exists that link to the profession, such as the sights and smells of breads and pastries, the visual in your mind’s eye of the corner bakery and the baker standing with their apron. Similarly, using bi-directional links in Logseq allows you to create multiple different hooks of association, facilitating improved retrieval and allowing us to abandon the location-dependent desktop/folder paradigm in our organisational practices.\nThis realisation came months before I appreciated Logseq as a text editor or outliner in my own journey. It seems trivial, but it is a powerful shift in approach. I no longer had to think about where to find information or worry about where to store it. This allowed me to offload my continual anxiety around \u0026lsquo;proper\u0026rsquo; organisation.\nThe graphic below illustrates the difference between mono-directional links (the traditional links on the internet) and bi-directional links.\nHow does Logseq’s combination of tools make it a standout integrated thinking environment? Sure, Logseq is an impressive combination of tools, but how will this help you think better? After all, that\u0026rsquo;s the main attraction of an ITE: an all-in-one GUI that improves thinking and original output. An ITE needs to meet a few criteria to do this.\nRyan Murphy (@ryanjamurphy on Twitter) has introduced the aptly-named \u0026lsquo;NOTE\u0026rsquo; framework to describe the core features of an integrated thinking environment - Navigability, Organisability, Transformability and Extensibility. Let’s look at each of these and see how they pertain to Logseq.\nNavigability speaks to the application\u0026rsquo;s ability to navigate your collection of thoughts and information quickly and intuitively. Logseq\u0026rsquo;s robust search and querying functionality, sidebars and various menus—not to mention the graph—tick the boxes for easy navigation. Bi-directional links also facilitate quick navigation as both source and target links are always available.\nOrganisability speaks to the features that allow you to structure and manage your information. Outlining is a crucial component of this. For everything else, there\u0026rsquo;s bi-directional linking. Links enable you to build associations throughout your database, which means that each piece of information is available via multiple contexts. This surpasses the desktop/folder paradigm, which limits a bit of information to a single location.\nAre you missing the folder approach? You can build \u0026lsquo;maps of content\u0026rsquo; with links (check out Linking Your Thinking). These ‘MOCs’ function as an index or ‘table of content’ for your database. By pointing to all the pieces of information you wish to access frequently, you’re mimicking the functionality of a folder. Add in the toolset of page properties, block properties and namespaces, and you have a robust set of mechanisms for effective organisation.\nTransformability speaks to the ability to use the content in your database as building blocks. For example, you may want to combine and reference different pieces of information and use queries to \u0026rsquo;re-display\u0026rsquo; information for a specific use case (e.g. managing a process). Logseq shines in this domain. You can think of any block of information in your Logseq database as a self-replicating LEGO brick, which can be used in multiple contexts. Logseq uses page references and block references to preserve the original information and build a rich network. Think of it as \u0026lsquo;copy-paste\u0026rsquo; functionality on steroids.\nExtensibility speaks to feature sets that allow you to access and use your information in customisable ways across various use cases, either through plug-ins or in other applications. Here is where Logseq\u0026rsquo;s core capability as a text editor shows its strength. You can open your Logseq files with any application that can read text tiles, from a simple program such as Notepad to the powerful Obsidian. In addition, because Logseq is open-source and has community built into its DNA, there is a large community of developers building an extensive plugin ecosystem that further enhances the tool\u0026rsquo;s extensibility.\nWhere to from here? Logseq easily ticks the boxes of this ITE framework, but it’s still early days in this new category of tools. The requirements will evolve rapidly, and the framework will inevitably need to be revised.\nAt the moment, the framework focuses largely on an individual user. The question remains, how might the requirements shift to accommodate thinking in a team environment? Text will inevitably remain the fundamental unit of information storage, but users will demand ways to represent and organise information graphically. Many personal knowledge management enthusiasts yearn for the intuitive experience of arranging physical index cards or sticky notes to compose their thoughts. Surely our applications of choice should allow us to map information on a visual-spatial canvas and mark it up with hand-drawn elements on our mobile device of choice? And yes, I want to do it all in one application.\nIf you’re a fan of Logseq, you’ll be pleased to know that the development team is already working hard to make these features a reality. Real-time collaboration and white-boarding are current development priorities. There are many challenges to overcome, but if you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the development of the tool over the last two years, you won\u0026rsquo;t doubt the team’s ability to develop a world-class product.\nIt doesn’t happen magically, but the Logseq team continues to make strong hires to support the challenging technical development and growing community. Logseq also recently secured $4.1 million in seed funding to make their dreams a reality. It seems like the stars are aligning.\nConclusion I often feel like I’m on a Logseq soapbox. I firmly believe the tool will measurably improve people’s ‘digital well-being’, and thereby maybe their overall well-being, if only they would take the plunge.\nIt may sound high and lofty for some, but a personal note-taking practice is a slippery slope to improved self-management. I love what Tiago Forte says about note-taking:\nNotetaking is just a trojan horse for self-awareness.\n\u0026mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) May 15, 2022 Almost everyone takes notes of some kind, be it using the default notes app on their phone or trusty pen and paper. Some take it further by using apps to manage multiple parts of their life and the accompanying streams of input and output. Before you know it, you’re entering the realm of personal knowledge management.\nThrough improved self-knowledge and with the ability to access information and resources seamlessly, I believe we can better solve problems and contribute to the world around us. However, change is hard, and time always feels like it’s rushing past. It might feel like transitioning your note-taking and information to Logseq is taking one step forward and two steps backwards as you learn how to work in different ways. But life is a marathon and not a sprint. Moving to Logseq might cause some short-term frustration, but I believe the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs.\nIf you’re new to Logseq, I hope your Logseq journey will be fruitful, and that you find as much joy as I have using the tool. I wish you the best of luck on your journey.\nP.S. Struggling to get to grips with the tool? It all sounds too good to be true. You get excited, open Logseq for the first time and encounter a blank journal page and the feeling of “now what?” sinks in. Many have felt this way. It’s impossible to deny that the transition into the world of Logseq can be intimidating. However, on the other side of the steep learning curve is a plateau of digital joy.\nIf you’re getting started and would like an in-depth guide to Logseq and how you can set up your own integrated thinking environment, have a look at my course, Logseq Mastery.\nThe course is divided into two units, which you can buy separately or in a bundle.\nUnit 1 looks at \u0026lsquo;Tutorials\u0026rsquo;, which detail the building blocks of Logseq as a tool and how to develop effective approaches for input, organisation and retrieval of your notes and information. It also gets into some Logseq power features and principles for effectively maintaining your Logseq database.\nUnit 2 looks at \u0026lsquo;Workflows \u0026amp; Systems\u0026rsquo;. Once you understand Logseq\u0026rsquo;s capabilities, you can build custom systems to manage your information.

I’ve been raving about Logseq for a while, but I haven’t really boiled down what’s so great about it. In this introductory video, I break down why outliners, particularly Logseq, are such great tools. If everything in this video sails over your head, then maybe this is the course for you. If you were nodding your head in agreement, then maybe the course is a bit too basic for you. Either way, I hope you like it!\nSetting up Logseq on your computer Setting up Logseq on your computer is easier than ever before. You can either use the web-app, or download the desktop app. The program is now Windows certified if you’re a Windows user, and the feature set is powerful (and only getting better with each release). For example, you can now upload PDFs into your Logseq database using the desktop version. This alone is well worth the switch!\nIntroduction to blocks and pages The block is the core functional unit of any outliner app. Pages allow you to link your blocks to around nodes of meaning and easily resurface them later down the line. They’re both key elements of Logseq, and you can develop workflows that use both of them to their full potential.\nAdding structure with bi-directional links Entering your notes into the Journal page is a new paradigm, but this doesn’t mean that you need to forsake all structure. The way you do that in a network note-taking app is by adding by-directional links. This allows you to resurface information in your database easily when you need it, whilst still allowing you to enter information in a low-friction way. Once you understand linking, you will be able to configure your own workflows more easily, and set-up a system that works the way that your own mind works.\nTagging for task management, spaced-repetition and easy resurfacing of information Logseq allows for additional ‘structural’ elements beyond bi-directional links. These include powerful task management capabilities, as well as a spaced repetition feature. On top of that, even if you haven’t been using bi-directional links, the interface easily allows you to find “unlinked” references and make connections after the fact, so you never have to worry about finding your information again.\nMaximising the user interface, and an intro to block references In addition to the powerful functionality covered in the first few videos, Logseq also has a great user interface which greatly assists in your note-taking / writing process. It’s all a key part of removing the friction in your day-to-day experience of writing and thinking.\nAnother powerful feature is the ability to transclude block references. That means that you can reference any block reference anywhere else in your database, and allows you to build context around your writing. If this is confusing, don’t worry — it’s not an essential “must-know” feature, although a lot of people have built powerful workflows with them so it’s worthwhile understanding if this might be of value to you.\nExploring the menus and other user interface elements (i.e. the graph 😉) In the penultimate video of the course, I get into a few more “functional” things — how do you navigate the menus, what do the different buttons do, a few of the nitty-gritty things. We’ll also expore the graph view (which is what initially got me hooked on Logseq!) and have a look at some of the settings you may want to use.\nSetting yourself up for success on Logseq To wrap it all up, I explore some of the philosophies around network note-taking and how to set yourself up for success. Specifically, we look at why block indenting is a key feature of an outliner, and how to set up entry points into your database to facilitate an effective writing experience. I’m personally also a fan of visual workflows, which help me to pick up where I left off a lot easier than if I’m looking at text on a screen.\nIf you found this post helpful, you might enjoy the full Logseq Mastery course. The course has a wealth of videos, detailed write-ups and diagrams to quickly master Logseq and save you plenty of time and headaches.\nTake me to Logseq Mastery Want to browse the course outline first?

I have been approached by numerous individuals and companies to try their software or courses, and most of the time I politely decline in order to prioritise my own projects. I will only promote products or services that I have used or am currently using. If approached by a company, I will only consider the product if it will add meaningful value to my life or address a clear challenge that I am experiencing. Here are some affiliate links below for services that I would recommend and a short write-up of why:\nShortform for high quality book summaries There are thousands of non-fiction books out there, and everyone is convinced that the current book on their nightstand is a \u0026lsquo;must-read\u0026rsquo;. Whilst I take note of these recommendations, there is only so much time in the world. We also all know the book that could have been a blog post, but then got padded with anecdotes to fill some page quota. Shortform\u0026rsquo;s book summary service saves me a ton of time and FOMO. Their one-pager summaries are excellent and have spared me many laborious reads. My current go-to recommendation for a book to start with is \u0026ldquo;Essentialism\u0026rdquo; by Greg McKeown (not a laborious read, but a good summary nonetheless.) Zoho One to build an operating system for your business Zoho One is an affordable Enterprise Resource Planning software solution for small to medium businesses. I use Zoho One for my business, CombiningMinds, across a number of different functions–website building, bookkeeping, customer relationship management, campaign management, surveys and feedback forms, and a host of others. In total there are over 45 integrated applications that make it the perfect operating system for your business. Systeme.io for an affordable all-in-one solution for online courses I wish I had discovered Systeme.io earlier. It\u0026rsquo;s cheaper than competitors like Thinkific, Teachable and Podia, but offers more value for money, with course hosting, email campaign management and website-building functionality. Setting up funnels and landing pages is quick, and the integrated email marketing is intuitive and easy to configure. The support team also have a good turnaround time on customer issues. There are some elements that could do with a bit of polish, but it\u0026rsquo;s unbeatable when it comes to value for money.\nGetting in touch Please use the email address dario \u0026lsquo;at\u0026rsquo; onestutteringmind \u0026lsquo;dot\u0026rsquo; com for any queries, feedback or just to say hi.
