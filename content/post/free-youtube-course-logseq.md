## What‚Äôs so special about Logseq?

I‚Äôve been raving about Logseq for a while, but I haven‚Äôt really boiled down what‚Äôs so great about it. In this introductory video, I break down why outliners, particularly Logseq, are such great tools. If everything in this video sails over your head, then maybe this is the course for you. If you were nodding your head in agreement, then maybe the course is a bit too basic for you. Either way, I hope you like it!

## Setting up Logseq on your computer

Setting up Logseq on your computer is easier than ever before. You can either use the web-app, or download the desktop app. The program is now Windows certified if you‚Äôre a Windows user, and the feature set is powerful (and only getting better with each release). For example, you can now upload PDFs into your Logseq database using the desktop version. This alone is well worth the switch!

## Introduction to blocks and pages

The block is the core functional unit of any outliner app. Pages allow you to link your blocks to around nodes of meaning and easily resurface them later down the line. They‚Äôre both key elements of Logseq, and you can develop workflows that use both of them to their full potential.

## Adding structure with bi-directional links

Entering your notes into the Journal page is a new paradigm, but this doesn‚Äôt mean that you need to forsake all structure. The way you do that in a network note-taking app is by adding by-directional links. This allows you to resurface information in your database easily when you need it, whilst still allowing you to enter information in a low-friction way. Once you understand linking, you will be able to configure your own workflows more easily, and set-up a system that works the way that your own mind works.

## Tagging for task management, spaced-repetition and easy resurfacing of information

Logseq allows for additional ‚Äòstructural‚Äô elements beyond bi-directional links. These include powerful task management capabilities, as well as a spaced repetition feature. On top of that, even if you haven‚Äôt been using bi-directional links, the interface easily allows you to find ‚Äúunlinked‚Äù references and make connections after the fact, so you never have to worry about finding your information again.

## Maximising the user interface, and an intro to block references

In addition to the powerful functionality covered in the first few videos, Logseq also has a great user interface which greatly assists in your note-taking / writing process. It‚Äôs all a key part of removing the friction in your day-to-day experience of writing and thinking.

Another powerful feature is the ability to transclude block references. That means that you can reference any block reference anywhere else in your database, and allows you to build context around your writing. If this is confusing, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî it‚Äôs not an essential ‚Äúmust-know‚Äù feature, although a lot of people have built powerful workflows with them so it‚Äôs worthwhile understanding if this might be of value to you.

## Exploring the menus and other user interface elements (i.e. the graph üòâ)

In the penultimate video of the course, I get into a few more ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù things ‚Äî how do you navigate the menus, what do the different buttons do, a few of the nitty-gritty things. We‚Äôll also expore the graph view (which is what initially got me hooked on Logseq!) and have a look at some of the settings you may want to use.

## Setting yourself up for success on Logseq

To wrap it all up, I explore some of the philosophies around network note-taking and how to set yourself up for success. Specifically, we look at why block indenting is a key feature of an outliner, and how to set up entry points into your database to facilitate an effective writing experience. I‚Äôm personally also a fan of visual workflows, which help me to pick up where I left off a lot easier than if I‚Äôm looking at text on a screen.
