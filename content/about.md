'I'm a monkey in the jungle.

Watching a vapor trail

Caught up in the conflict

Between his brain and his tail'

{{< spotify type="track" id="1PpfeNl5uYRBhfFcig2Uz6" width="100%" height="152" >}}

'What I know, is that I don't know

And now I dance and I sing and I live full

I give it all to the call of the unknown'

{{< spotify type="track" id="1md2Iw5RdKldgfM9c6WvUv" width="100%" height="152" >}}

'Hou op om fokken rond te kyk
Jy's hier om te dans'
_(Stop f'n looking around
You're here to dance)_ 

{{< spotify type="track" id="0UAFICnTdfQF37qPTAAoJB" width="100%" height="152" >}}


'We hold the light we overcome
We are the power
We are the legends
We are in a beautiful place'

{{< spotify type="track" id="7tdviypkABEstu9z7gSB27" width="100%" height="152" >}}

'That's the birth of responsibility
Because otherwise
You can always look over your shoulder and say
"Well, I am the way I am because my mother dropped me
And she dropped me because she was neurotic
Because her mother dropped her"
And way back you go to Adam and Eve
Or to a disappearing monkey or something
We never get at it'

### Confused? Don't worry, me too.

But I've learnt to live with that.

I've put together this website to **capture some thoughts on this rich and sometimes scary experience of life.** I've been hesitant to share my writing historically because I've been afraid of what people will think, but then I realised that I don't need to care what people think. Life is one long lesson, if nothing else.

Anyways, one thing I can say is that **I hope you find some value here**. If you do, drop me a mail - it would be great to hear from you üëãüèΩ

If you enjoyed some of the music above (or even if you didn't), maybe you'll enjoy some more beats.

You're welcome üòâ
